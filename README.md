- When looking at our age demographics, it is evident that Heroes of Pymoli is most popular with people between the ages of 20 to 24 and least popular with people over the age of 40. This means that we should be focusing on marketing Heroes of Pymoli to individuals between the ages of 20 to 24, not to individuals over the age of 40. Since it has been proven that the game is most popular with young adults.
